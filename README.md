# Housing Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing housing market data to uncover insights about the relationships between property prices and various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, and location (area, city, governorate).

## Analysis Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and standardizing numerical and categorical data.
2. **Univariate Analysis:** Exploring individual variables using histograms, density plots, boxplots, violin plots, and count plots to understand their distributions.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Examining relationships between pairs of variables, including scatter plots, bar plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
4. **Categorical Encoding:** Mapping categorical variables to numeric codes to prepare the dataset for modeling or statistical analysis.
5. **Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate insightful visualizations for better understanding of data patterns.
